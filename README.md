Fremont bridge visualization using crossfilter.js

This project uses an MV(?) approach to visualize data regarding the number of bikers crossing the 
Fremont Bridge in Seattle, WA. 

Here is a link to the data: https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k

I wanted to use crossfilter.js to filter data across charts.  I started with this example (though departed significantly):

Libraries used include:

d3.js
jquery
poshytip
crossfilter.js
